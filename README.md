# Install
Put the ZyHelperBetaAdapter.cs file into \th\plugins\Zy in your TurboHUD folder and the .exe somewhere else.

Start Zyhelper then start TurboHUD (You always have to start them in this order).

# How to use:

Per skill there are 2 Boxes:

The Enabled Checkbox which enables/disables the skill.

Note that the skill wont get casted if its not equipped.

The Hotkey Field which contains the hotkey thats going to get pressed by the program.

Here '1-9' 'a-z' mean their respective letters, while 'R' / 'L' mean the left / right mouse button.

For force stand still the additional hotkeys "shift", "alt" and "space" work.

The Nacro has some additional features:

'Second Sim' makes sim and land cast after 10-20 seconds so there is always a sim active if you play in a party.

Hexing Pants makes you move around while idle to always keep them up. For this you need Forcemove bound to Mouse3 (pressing the mousewheel).

# Wiz macro:

There are 3 hotkeys you need to use:


- Macro button:

It presses electrocute -> meteor -> channel -> archon.

So, if you want to shoot meteors, you hold down this button.


- Channelling button:
This one presses Ray of Frost in a way that it doesn't fuck up the macro.

So, if you want to channel to generate / proc zodiac, you hold this button.

But for example, if you get wormholed, you can release this button, walk back and the resume holding it.


So, in a normal rotation, you start holding the channeling key and the macro key when you're almost out of archon, then it should do the macro till you're back in Archon.

If you get wormholed and have enough cdr to miss some zodiac procs, you let go of the channelling hotkey while still holding the macro key, move back into the pull and then resume holding the channelling key.


- Oculus button:
When you spawn an oculus with the first meteor you can save the position of the oculus by pressing the oculus key while pointing at it.

if you have done that, the macro will walk into the oculus after shooting the arcane meteor.

For this to work you need to set the 'Force move hotkey' to your forcemove key.
